Submitting Assignment 2

Hi,
Thank you for taking time to review my submission.

My submission consists of the following codes-
1. Assignment_Easy_Moderate_Hard- That calls easy, moderate and hard codes. The codes simultaneously in all the sheets of the worksheet.
2. There are basically 4 main sub codes viz- ticker(), total_volume(), yearly_change() and greates_values()
Please Note-
1. The code has been submitted as a separate file that is affliated to a blank excel worksheet.
2. The code should be run only once. if done multiple times, then i am afraid we will end up having multiple columns for yearly_changes and percentage_changes

I have tried my level best to communicate through comments. If there is anything you wont understand, then please let me know. Happy to clarify.

Thanks.

Pravin
